                Welcome to my project for phase 2 at Flatiron School! My name is Hana, and
                I made this since I need to track my own meals. <br /> <br />                
                You can use this app to track your meal intake during the day.
                It's recommended to have breakfast, lunch, and dinner with a snack in 
                between each meal or three snacks total in a day. Remember to drink water too!
